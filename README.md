# Universal Simhub Dashboard

This is a hacky attempt at creating an easily configurable universal SimHub dashboard,
because I was annoyed at having to create new dashes and/or create conditions
for different types of car, class or game.

## Dependencies

- SimHub by SHWotever
- Enabled System Info plugin in SimHub (instructions available on the [SimHub Wiki](https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/System-informations))
- The super helpful
  [SimHub NeoRed Plugins](https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/lmu-neosuperdash.77210/)
  by Haagel -
  only needed if you want to use this dash for Le Mans Ultimate.
  (originally I wanted to use just native SimHub properties,
  but LMU is still building up native support for
  SimHub and may not ever have all of the needed propertie)

## Installation

### From source

- Clone the repository
- Copy the contents into your `SimHub/DashTemplates` folder

Alternatively, clone the repository directly into a folder in
`SimHub/DashTemplates`, and then you can `git pull` to stay up to date.

### From zip

- Download the zip file for the version of the dashboard you'd like to use
- Extract the zip file anywhere
